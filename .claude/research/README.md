# Research Documents

This directory contains research findings for exploratory tasks and technology evaluations.

## When to Create Research Documents

Create a research document when:

- Evaluating multiple approaches for a feature
- Investigating new technologies or libraries
- Comparing performance of different solutions
- Assessing security implications of different patterns
- Spike/proof-of-concept work before full implementation

## Template

Use this template for new research documents:

# Research: [Topic]

## Goal
[What we're trying to achieve and why]

## Options Evaluated

### Option 1: [Name]
- **Description**: [Brief overview]
- **Pros**:
  - [Advantage 1]
  - [Advantage 2]
- **Cons**:
  - [Disadvantage 1]
  - [Disadvantage 2]
- **Performance**: [Metrics, benchmarks, considerations]
- **Security**: [Concerns, mitigations]
- **Developer Experience**: [Ease of use, learning curve]
- **Community Support**: [GitHub stars, maintenance status, documentation quality]
- **Cost**: [Bundle size, runtime overhead, hosting costs]
- **Examples**: [Links to real-world usage]

### Option 2: [Name]

### Option 3: [Name]
[Same structure as Option 1]

## Comparison Matrix

| Criteria | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Security | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| DX | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Bundle Size | 50KB | 120KB | 30KB |

## Recommendation

**Chosen approach**: [Option X]

**Rationale**:
- [Key reason 1 - why this option is best for our use case]
- [Key reason 2 - how it aligns with project goals]
- [Key reason 3 - trade-offs we're willing to accept]

**Implementation notes**:
- [Key consideration 1 to remember during implementation]
- [Key consideration 2 - gotchas or best practices]
- [Key consideration 3 - integration points with existing code]

**Alternatives considered**:
- If [Option X] doesn't work out, fall back to [Option Y] because [reason]
